===================
This is a submission for Project Assignment for the data science Coursera course
     Getting and Cleaning Data.
     
Just execute the script "run_analysis.R", making sure the working directory
contains the Samsung data files. I.e. the working directory should contain:

the files
    - activity_labels.txt
    - features.txt
    - features_info.txt
    - README.txt
    - result.txt

and the folders
    - test
    - train

The script will read the data files and write the results in a new file called
    - result.txt

You can open the script to review its source code, which is commented.
